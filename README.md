# Doubly-Linked-List-in-MASM-Using-Irvine32-Library-
"This MASM-based doubly linked list manages up to 15 nodes using a fixed memory pool, avoiding dynamic allocation. It supports adding, deleting, and traversing nodes in both directions. Built with the Irvine32 library, it efficiently demonstrates fundamental linked list operations with manual memory handling."
